# Final Lab Evaluation

## AIML-ES1701 
Problem Statement: Sentiment Analysis

## Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning
This project demonstrates the implementation of various machine learning models for sentiment analysis on a text dataset. The goal is to classify text data into positive or negative sentiments based on the extracted features.

## Dataset
- https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products
The dataset used in this project consists of 27,701 training samples and 12,526 distinct words. The text data is preprocessed using the Bag of Words strategy and the TfidfTransformer to extract meaningful features.

## Feature Extraction
The Bag of Words strategy is employed to convert the text data into numerical feature vectors. This involves the following steps:



## Machine Learning Models
The project evaluates the performance of several machine learning models for sentiment analysis:

- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- These models are trained and evaluated using the extracted features from the text data. The evaluation metrics used are accuracy and F1 score.

### Evaluation Metric Used : F1 Score
